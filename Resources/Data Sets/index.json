Bem and<BR>   Honorton then presented data from studies conducted with the improved<BR>   procedure. Table 13.1 presents basic data from 10 studies reported by Bem and<BR>   Honorton (1994).

              "description": " Self-explaining is a learning strategy where students write or say their own<BR>   explanations of the material they are studying. Self-explaining has generally<BR>   been found to be more effective than standard studying, but it may also take<BR>   more time. This raises the question of whether it's the study strategy or the<BR>   extra time that benefits learning. To explore this issue, grade school<BR>   children took a pretest of mathematics conceptual knowledge, studied<BR>   mathematics problems, and then took a similar posttest (McEldoon et al.,<BR>   2013). Participants were randomly assigned to one of two study conditions:<BR>   normal study + more practice (More Practice group), or self-explaining<BR>   (Self-Explain group). The first condition was intended to make time spent<BR>   learning to be similar for the two groups. You can find part of the data from<BR>   this study in SelfExplain, the scores being percent correct.<BR>  ",

              "description": " You're excited! Your company has developed a wonderful new weight-loss<BR>   program, and now it's your job to develop the ad campaign. Should you choose<BR>   a BeforeAfter pair of pictures, as in Figure 14.1, top panel? Or might a<BR>   Progressive sequence of pictures of the same person, as in the bottom panel,<BR>   be more effective? Pause, think, and discuss. Which would you choose, and<BR>   why? You might think that BeforeAfter is simpler and more dramatic. On the<BR>   other hand, Progressive highlights the steady improvement that you claim the<BR>   program will deliver. You're probably not surprised to learn that BeforeAfter<BR>   is used often and has long been a favorite of the advertising industry,<BR>   whereas Progressive is used only rarely. Luca Cian and colleagues (Cian et<BR>   al., 2020) were curious to know the extent to which BeforeAfter is actually<BR>   more effective, appealing, and credible than Progressive, or, indeed, whether<BR>   Progressive might score more highly. They reported seven studies of various<BR>   aspects of that question. I'll focus on their Study 2, in which they used<BR>   three independent groups to compare all three conditions illustrated in<BR>   Figure 14.1. The BeforeAfterInfo condition, in the middle panel, comprises<BR>   three BeforeAfter pairs, thus providing extra information about the before<BR>   and after endpoints. The researchers included this condition in case any<BR>   advantage of Progressive might stem simply from having more images, rather<BR>   than because it illustrates a clear progressive sequence. They randomly<BR>   assigned 213 participants from MTurk to one of the three groups. Participants<BR>   were asked to 'imagine that you have decided to lose some weight', then saw<BR>   one of the three ads for a weight loss program called MRMDiets. They then<BR>   answered the question 'How would you evaluate MRMDiets?' by choosing a 1-7<BR>   response on several scales, including Unlikeable-Likable,<BR>   Ineffective-Effective, and Not credible-Credible. The researchers averaged<BR>   six such scores to give an overall Credibility score, on the 1-7 scale, with<BR>   7 being the most credible. Simmons and Nelson (2020) were sufficiently<BR>   intrigued to carry out two substantial very close replications. With the<BR>   cooperation of the original researchers, they used the same materials and<BR>   procedure. They used much larger groups and preregistered their research<BR>   plan, including data analysis plan. I'll focus on their first replication, in<BR>   which 761 participants from MTurk were randomized to the three groups.<BR>  ",
